# roman-cli
roman numeral calculator

# Setup
Ensure you have node 8.x.x or higher.

Run `npm install` in the root directory.

After that just run `node index.js <math goes here>` and you are good to go!

# Description

This application expects a string of roman numerals in postfix notation.
Input should look something like this:

```'XIV V M + L *'```

The output is written to standard out but could easily be edited to return the value if needed in a frontend project.

In a perfect world there would be tests for this as well. I just didn't have the time unfortunately.
